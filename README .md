# Frontend Design for Immigrant-Management-System

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This repository contains the frontend design for the Immigrant-Management-System Android app. The app is built using Jetpack Compose, Volley library, and Kotlin Coroutines to provide a modern and efficient user interface for managing immigrants.

## Backend Code

For the backend implementation of the Immigrant-Management-System, please refer to the following repository:

[Immigrant-Management-System Backend](https://github.com/dipankarupd/Immigrants-Management-System-Backend)

## Getting Started

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

1. Ensure you have Android Studio installed with a device or emulator running Android API level 21 or higher.

1. Open the project in Android Studio.

1. Review the `Constants.kt` file located at `app/src/main/java/com/example/immigrantmanagementsystem/view/utils/Constants.kt`. Make sure the `BASE\_URL` constant is set to the correct URL of the backend API.

```kotlin

const val BASE\_URL = "https://immigrants-management-system.onrender.com"

```

1. Install any required dependencies by syncing the project.

1. Run the app on your device or emulator to start using the Immigrant-Management-System frontend.

## Dependencies

Ensure all dependencies for the project are added correctly. The primary dependencies used are:

- Jetpack Compose: For building the modern UI.
- Volley: For making API requests to the backend.
- Kotlin Coroutines: For handling asynchronous tasks.
- AndroidX: For various Android support libraries.

These dependencies are managed through the `build.gradle` files.
